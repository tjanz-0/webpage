I also adopted a white pillar from the reference, which is placed on either side of the composition. This achieves the effect of observing the scene through a window, which the reference utilizes as well. In contrast to the reference, I chose a neutral background in order to put more emphasis towards the two portrayed figures."

For this painting, I combined the horse from Franz Marc's ''Der blaue Reiter'' with a german crate of beer in front of an abstract background. This is of course a bit comical, but in the same way makes the composition interesting to look at. The painting was a housewarming gift for my sister and her boyfriend. Although the process of painting this took much longer than anticipated, I enjoyed every minute of working on it. Besides this, I like the painting because it breaks the classyness accredited to the 'Franz Marc Horse'. It puts it into an environment where you feel much less pretentious when looking at it for longer periods of time."

I set up the composition as shown with real props and painted it. With this painting, I aimed to train the use of expressionistic stylistic devices in order to convey for example the dancing light of the candle or the blurry jittering of the dark background. In alignment with this, I tried to keep brush strokes dynamic and distinctively visible. In some places, the paper background pushes through. On the table cloth, some of the purple lines are more grainy than others, aiming to convey texture."

              data-description="Still life of an apple, a bottle and some flowers. A study of cubist painters. With this painting, I experimented with the cubist method of capturing objects from different angles. For this, I set up the composition as described, started to copy some lines from one perspective, then changed it and repeated this process over some iterations. In the finsihed result, this had more effect on background elements than the objects themselves. This could probably be counteracted by copying less object lines in each perspective or by utilizing narrower brush strokes. In some places, I used the lines I copied from the composition to create some cartoonic effects, which introduce some movement to the composition. As most of the painting is rather dark, I used very bright highlights for contrast."

Being heavily inspired by an artist I found on the internet, I both tried to copy some compositions that I liked as well as creating some of my own by variation of perspective and color. This type of portrait helps a lot in training the ability to come up with motives without relying on an exact reference. You can first block in some colors without putting too much thought into it, then draw in the features you imagine to see in these with a pencil."

        <p>The digitization of my old paintings and drawings is an ongoing work in progress.</p>
        <p>I aim to continously improve this showcase by new additions, better photographs, improved website functionality and so on.</p>
        <p>Regarding the artworks: I like to emerge into the styles of different artists, a lot of what is shown are essentially 'case studies'.</p>
        <p>For some of the artworks, I didn't come up with some of the showcased motives myself — I try to convey 'what comes from where' in the image descriptions.</p>
        <p>In general, I found that I prefer working with some sort of a reference.</p>
        <p>I enjoy studying artists, places and objects much more than I do painting 'from nothing'.</p>

        <p>The aim behind this video was to explore fluid-painting from a different perspective.</p>
        <p>Contrary to the static works on canvas, video-recording allows to capture the dynamics of the observed flow of colors, not just a snapshot of them in time.</p>
        <p>In this way, the abstract spaces forming can be explored with more dimensionality.</p>
        <p>Close-up shots and camera movements are used to enhance the immersiveness of these spaces.</p>
        <p>Don't mind the spelling error in the beginning, I lost the Premiere file to this project and had to help myself in this way.</p>
